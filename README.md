# Sass Components

## NOTES

The basic HTML wrapper and JavaScript setup on each file is TERRIBLE I HIGHLY recommend you use these components with a solid framework of your choosing it will make using them SUPER simple, I tried to keep these pieces as HTML powered as  I can, however some will still require certain classes being added and other event listeners. This repo uses all vanilla JS libraries and other code, but it's kind of sloppy, since the main purpose of this repo is the sass components and what they achieve.

## How-To

Uses `sass-pack` in order to compile down the sass files into usable CSS. 

- Clone Repo
- cd into Repo
- `npm i`
- `npm run init`
- Go to http://localhost:5000

You should now be able to view an demo page of the library.
